- A recent version of **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=fr)** (Koala 2024.1.2 or Ladybug 2024.2.1 are recommended).  
  This application has been developed with Android Studio Koala (2024.1.2) and Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2.1) versions. Installation for these versions can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive).

> **Android Studio** will automatically handle SDK and tool installations when you open the project.  
> For reference, this project uses:
> - `compileSdk` = 34
> - `targetSdk` = 34
> - `minSdk` = 26
> - JDK 8 or higher


## Usage

Open the project with Android Studio.

To use the application, you should first build the project in the IDE.  
Please note that the AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) version must be compatible with your version of Android Studio before building.  
If it is not the case, you can directly change the AGP version in the file `cortest/gradle/libs.versions.toml`, here is an example of what you may find in it :


```toml title="cortest/gradle/libs.versions.toml"
# ...

[versions]
activityCompose = "1.9.3"
activityComposeVersion = "1.7.2"
agp = "8.6.0" # --> you can change the AGP version here, for reference 8.6.0 is the version compatible with Android Studio Koala
androidxCameraCameraCore3 = "1.5.0"
androidxCoreKtx = "1.12.0"
androidxJunit = "1.1.5"
androidxLifecycleRuntimeKtx = "2.6.1"
androidxMaterial = "1.5.2"

# ...
```

If the build was successful, you should be able to run the application on a physical device connected via USB cable or over WiFi or on a virtual device directly on Android Studio.

Running the project will install the app on your device. You will then be able to launch the app through its icon or the widget.
